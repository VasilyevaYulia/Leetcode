#Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.
#The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        a = sorted(nums)
        return a[n//2]
